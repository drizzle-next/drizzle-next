# Drizzle Next Documentation

Drizzle Next is a TypeScript scaffolding automation web framework.

It is a CLI Tool that generates full stack scaffolding for apps built with Next.js and Drizzle ORM.

User and Admin dashboards with authentication and authorization are optionally included.

## Introduction

Drizzle Next is an ephemeral web framework.

You do not install it into your project as a dependency.

It is a command line interface code generation tool.

The generated code is fully customizable as it is written to your project, and not an external dependency.

## Why Drizzle Next?

TL;DR I was inspired by 5 tools:

- Ruby on Rails - for the idea of scaffolding
- Next.js - for making React development easier
- TypeScript - for less bugs
- Drizzle ORM - for query builder, ORM, and plain SQL migrations
- shadcn/ui - for customizable components
