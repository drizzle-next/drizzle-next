# Drizzle Next Documentation

Drizzle Next is a TypeScript web framework for scaffolding automation.

This CLI Tool generates full-stack scaffolding for apps built with Next.js and Drizzle ORM.

It also supports generating user and admin dashboards to kickstart your development process.

## Introduction

Drizzle Next is an ephemeral web framework.

Unlike traditional frameworks, it is not installed into your project as a dependency.

Instead, it is a command line interface code generation tool with a focus on minimum dependencies.

The generated code is fully customizable as it is written to your project, and not an external dependency.

## Why Drizzle Next?

TL;DR: Drizzle Next combines proven technologies with innovative ideas to elevate your development workflow:

- Next.js: For its seamless React integration and powerful server-side capabilities.
- TypeScript: For type safety and fewer bugs.
- Drizzle ORM: For a TypeScript-first query builder, ORM, and plain SQL migrations.
- Ruby on Rails: For the concept of scaffolding to speed up development.
- shadcn/ui: For the idea of customizable, copy-and-paste-ready components.
