Full Stack TypeScript Scaffolding Framework

Build Next.js Apps Faster With:<br>
✅ Ruby on Rails Inspired Scaffolding Automations<br>
✅ shadcn/ui Inspired Customizable Components<br>
✅ Django Inspired Admin Dashboard

## Introduction

shadjs is a full stack automation tool for building TypeScript web applications. This is an ephemeral web framework. You do not install it into your project as a dependency. It is a command line interface code generation tool. You use it to generate customizable code for full stack projects. You can scaffold database schemas and user interfaces to use as a reference to build your own full stack application.

## Tech stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - JavaScript With Types
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - UI Components
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - Object Relational Mapper
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) - Authentication
- [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) - Payments
- [zod](https://zod.dev/) - Validation

## Installation

### Step 1: Create new project

Start by creating a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --no-src-dir --no-import-alias
```

Alternatively, you can use shadjs to generate a new Next.js project using the recommended settings:

```
npx shadjs@latest new my-app
```

### Step 2: Run the CLI

Run the `shadjs init` command to setup your project.

```bash
npx shadjs@latest init
```

### Step 3: Configure project

You will be asked a few questions to configure the app.

```
? Which package manager do you want to use? npm
? Do you want to install latest packages or pinned packages? pinned
? Which database dialect would you like to use? sqlite
? Which primary key generation strategy would you like to use? cuid2
? Which authentication solution do you want to use? authjs
? Which auth providers would you like to use? github, google, credentials
? Do you want to add an admin dashboard with role-based authorization? yes
```

Alternatively, you can also run the command non-interactively:

```bash
npx shadjs@latest init -p npm --latest --db-dialect sqlite -pk cuid2 --auth-solution authjs --auth-providers github,google,credentials --admin
```

### Step 4: Project checklist

After initialization, you will be prompted to complete a few additional checklist items depending on the options you chose. For example:

- Update secrets in `.env.local`.
- Run database migrations.
- Set up the auth providers.
- Create a test user.
- Grant admin privilege.

## Scaffold

After the initial configuration is completed, you can create full stack scaffolding with the `scaffold` command.

This command will generate the user interface, database migration and schema, server actions, server components, and client components of a full stack feature.

The `-c` option takes a space-separated string of column configurations in the following format: `column_name:dataType`.

The `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields are automatically generated by shadjs, and should be omitted from the command.

After scaffolding, you can review the schema and make any necessary changes before running the database migrations.

## Scaffold examples

For example, this command generates a typical blog application:

### sqlite example

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c title:text content:text is_draft:boolean published_at:text
```

### postgresql example

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c title:text content:text is_draft:boolean published_at:timestamp
```

### mysql example

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c title:varchar content:text is_draft:boolean published_at:timestamp
```

## Data types

**postgresql data types**

integer, smallint, bigint, serial, smallserial, bigserial, boolean, text, varchar, char, numeric, decimal, real, doublePrecision, json, jsonb, time, timestamp, date, uuid

**mysql data types**

int, tinyint, smallint, mediumint, bigint, real, decimal, double, float, serial, binary, varbinary, char, varchar, text, boolean, date, datetime, time, year, timestamp, json

**sqlite data types**

integer, real, text, boolean, bigint, timestamp

## Primary key generation strategy

shadjs supports the following primary key generation strategies:

- `cuid2` - Uses the `@paralleldrive/cuid2` package
- `uuidv7` - Uses the `uuidv7` package
- `uuidv4` - Uses the `crypto` package
- `nanoid` - Uses the `nanoid` package

The strategy that you choose during the `init` process will be saved in `shadjs.config.json`. This will be used for the authentication, stripe, and scaffold schemas.

## Foreign key constraints

shadjs supports adding foreign key constraints using the following special data types:

- `references`
- `references_combobox`
- `references_select`

This will set up the Drizzle relations and the UI form controls for managing the relations.

For example, a one to many relationship where a post belongs to a category can be set up using the following scaffolds.

First, scaffold the `one` side of the relationship.

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold category -c title:text
```

Second, scaffold the `many` side of the relationship using one of the references data types below:

### References Input

The standard `references` data type will use an Input component that accepts a foreign key string.

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c category:references title:text
```

These commands work best when the column name is singular, (e.g. `category:references`), so that shadjs can reference the correct foreign key field (e.g. `category_id`).

### References Combobox

The `references_combobox` data type will use a Generic Combobox component where you can search for and select the related item.

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c category:references_combobox title:text
```

You can add additional fields to search using the `keywordFields` prop. You can also change the template of the rendered items. For example:

```tsx
<GenericCombobox
  list={categoryList}
  name="categoryId"
  valueField="id"
  searchPlaceholder="Search Categories..."
  selectPlaceholder="Select Category..."
  emptyText="No category found"
  keywordFields={["id", "title"]}
  template={(item) => <div>{item.title}</div>}
/>
```

### References Select

The `references_select` data type will use a Generic Select component where you can select from a dropdown list of items.

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold post -c category:references_select title:text
```

## Many To Many Relations

The `join` command generates a basic user interface for managing many to many relations.

You must have an existing scaffold for the left table, join table, and right table for this command to work.

For example, if you already have a `posts` table, `posts_tags` table, and `tags` table, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx shadjs@latest join posts posts_tags tags
```

This will add a link to each row on the posts table. The link will take you to a management interface for adding tags to the post using a generic checkbox list.

Inversely, you can swap the left and right tables to add the links to the opposite table:

```bash
npx shadjs@latest join tags posts_tags posts
```

## File uploads

shadjs supports a `file` data type. This creates a text db column to store the file path along with a basic ui for uploads to the file system

Example:

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold media -c title:text image:file video:file
```

Note: Next.js only generates routes for public files at compile time. If you need to serve the uploaded files, putting them into the `public` directory will not work in production without a new build every time.

If the uploaded files need to be served immediately after uploading, consider using a web server like nginx to serve the static files or an s3 compatible bucket instead.

In development, shadjs will put the files in `public/uploads`, so that they can be served during development. This works in development because routes are compiled without running a new build.

In production, shadjs will put the files in `/var/www/uploads`. You'll have to find a way to serve these files. For example, pointing an nginx location `/uploads/` to the `/var/www/uploads` folder. Note: This won't work in serverless environments. If you're using serverless, consider using object storage like s3.

The file URI will be saved to the database. The upload paths can be changed in `file-utils.ts`.

Example nginx config:

```
server {
      listen 80;
      server_name www.example.com;

       location /uploads/ {
          alias /var/www/uploads/;
          autoindex off;
          try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }

       location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;
       }
}
```

Tip: The Next.js `Image` component performs automatic resizing of images. This works well for static images. However, uploaded images will not show up immediately unless you use the `unoptimized` attribute. Alternatively, you can use a regular `img` tag.

## Auth

If auth was enabled during initialization, you will be able to scaffold using a `private` authorization level. These pages along with the server actions will require a user to be authenticated to access.

shadjs provides a `create-user.ts` script to create test users.

shadjs uses the `jwt` strategy of Auth.js. If you need `database` sessions, you will have to provide the implementation. Note: the `credentials` provider only supports the `jwt` strategy.

### Private Dashboard

If auth was enabled, users will be able to sign in and access a user dashboard at `/dashboard`.

Any pages scaffolded with a `private` authorization level will be placed into the the `(private)` route group.

After running a private scaffold, a new link to the resource list page will be added to `private-sidebar.tsx`.

Users can sign in at `/signin`.

### Admin Dashboard

If admin was enabled, users with the `admin` role will be able to access the admin dashboard at `/admin`. The admin login is at `/admin-login`.

You will be able to scaffold using an `admin` authorization level. The pages will be put into the `(admin)` route group. These pages along with the server actions will require a user with the `admin` role to access.

After running an admin scaffold, a new link to the resource list page will be added to `admin-sidebar.tsx`.

A `grant-admin.ts` script is provided to grant users the admin role.

The application uses a `role` text field to determine the user's role. Any user with an `admin` role will have admin access.

Users will be assigned a `user` role when created. This behavior can be changed in `auth.ts`.

An authorization check happens at the admin `layout.tsx`.

## Add-on Extensions

Add-ons are full stack components that can be added after a project has been initialized.

An add-on extension can be added using the `add` command.

To see a list of available add-ons, run `npx shadjs@latest add -h`.

The `add` command will install all necessary UI components, npm dependencies and dev dependencies for the add-on.

Then it will write all of the necessary code for the add-on to your project.

### Stripe

```bash
npx shadjs@latest add stripe
```

Code will be generated for a one-time purchase, monthly subscription plan, and a dynamic pricing checkout. This includes the webhook, checkout session, and customer portal api endpoints.

A pricing page will be generated. The buttons will initiate a stripe checkout if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, they will redirect to the sign in page.

A `create-price.ts` script is provided to create the initial products on Stripe and on the local database. This is required before using the one-time purchase and subscription plan.

The dynamic pricing does not require creating and mapping to products on Stripe. Dynamic pricing is useful if you need to generate a custom price, manage products, and manage and orders in the application.

The file `access.ts` contain utility functions to check user access to products and subscriptions. You can use this as you build out the paywall for the paid features.

Any of the code and content can be changed to fit your business model. The goal of this Stripe automation is to provide some common integration patterns to use as a starting point.

### Tiptap Editor

```bash
npx shadjs@latest add tiptap
```

This add-on will install several tiptap dependencies and write the code for a generic tiptap editor component.

After installing the add-on, you'll be able to scaffold with a `text_tiptap` data type.

For example:

```bash
npx shadjs@latest scaffold posts -c title:text content:text_tiptap
```

## Naming conventions

shadjs uses naming conventions as described in the table below. Number and case transformations will be applied to the generated code.

| Generated Code                     | Number           | Case         | Example                 |

## Philosophy

### Technology curation

Many decisions happen at the beginnings of projects. A developer must decide on: a web framework, a database, UI component library, object relational mapper (ORM), CSS framework, authentication solution, validation library, payment solution, and other technologies relevant to the project. This can be time consuming and lead to decision fatigue. In the JavaScript world, this is known as JavaScript fatigue. It is a phenomenon describing the overwhelming array of technology choices in the JavaScript ecosystem. shadjs offers a preferred list of technologies to be used as a foundation for web app projects.

### Configuration automation

Once the technologies are decided on, the next step is to wire everything together such that the application works as a cohesive whole. This means making sure the database connection is working, the UI component library is installed, and that integrations with external services are working.

Developers will often use libraries to add capabilities such as authentication, data validations, and payments. However, setting these up can be time consuming. shadjs provides an `init` command which allows you to choose from a short menu of features that you can add to your Next.js app. shadjs will write all the code necessary for the selected features.

By having a simple working example, you'll save time not having to build it entirely from scratch. You can customize the generated code to fit your project requirements. Additionally, shadjs will display a checklist of tasks to complete the initial configuration. The `init` command is intended to be run once at the beginning of a new project.

### Scaffold automation

Once the technologies are selected and configured, the next step is to begin building the interesting parts of the app. Typically, this involves a number of tasks including creating the database tables, API endpoints or server actions, user interface, layouts, pages, and web forms. This process may involve referencing documentation and writing the "boilerplate" code that the rest of the app will be built upon. This too is a time consuming process.

shadjs provides a `scaffold` command to automate the entire process of setting up the initial "boilerplate" code. You only have to provide the table name along with the columns and data types. shadjs will generate the database migration files, back end code, and front end code for the provided database schema.

What is the purpose of the scaffolded code? It is to provide a fully working full stack Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) feature that you can use as a reference to build the rest of your app. The `scaffold` command is intended to be run as many times as you need to generate full stack scaffolding. This automation is heavily inspired by the Ruby on Rails scaffold command.

## Technology and Inspiration

### Ruby on Rails

Nostalgia for Ruby on Rails style development is one motivation that led to the creation of shadjs. The `shadjs scaffold` command was modeled after the `rails scaffold` command. With a predefined set of conventions, you'll spend less time configuring things, and more time building.

### Django

The built-in admin interface for Django was convenient. If I could somehow build a light-weight version of that in TypeScript, along with a scaffold command like Rails, with fully customizable components like shadcn/ui...

### TypeScript

TypeScript adds additional syntax for types to JavaScript. This enables the early catching of errors in your editor and at compile time.

### Next.js

Many of the full stack patterns used in shadjs are based on the official Next.js documentation. Next.js provides many conveniences out of the box, such as file system routing, server side rendering, code bundling, and more.

### shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui is the tool that copies and pastes beautifully styled components into your projects. Similarly, shadjs generates full stack components into your Next.js project. You have full control of the code that is generated instead of the code being hidden behind an external package.

### Drizzle ORM

Drizzle ORM provides both SQL-like and relational queries, as well as schema generation and database migrations. If you know SQL, you know Drizzle. If you prefer an ORM, you can use their query API. Drizzle always outputs 1 query.

### TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a CSS framework which provides reusable utility classes. TailwindCSS simplifies and improves scalability of styling by coupling markup with style.

### Auth.js

shadjs favors proven, open-source solutions that let you maintain control over your data. Similarly, with shadjs, you own not only your data but also your code.

### Zod

shadjs uses `zod` and `drizzle-zod` for data validations. Each server action that is generated by the scaffolding tool will also contain zod validations to check for the correctness of data being submitted.

## FAQ

**What can I build with shadjs?**

shadjs is suitable for full stack monolithic server side rendered web applications. It is a full stack tool kit that automates away the time consuming things you need to do at the start of a new full stack Next.js project, saving you days worth of boilerplate coding.

**What is a scaffold?**

A scaffold is all of the starter code, including the UI and data layer, that is required to have a fully functional CRUD application. Scaffolding was popular in MVC frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. With scaffolding, you spend less time looking things up because there is a point of reference to build upon. This frees up time and energy to focus on building the interesting parts of the app.

**Why not a web framework?**

shadjs differs in that it provides an opinionated abstraction for creating a solid starting point for app development. shadjs works by writing code to a new Next.js project. The code is written to your Next.js repo and you can review it before committing to anything.

**Why not a boilerplate?**

Boilerplates go obsolete fast. Shadjs offers a `latest` option to install latest dependencies. This means you'll get the latest version of Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui components, Auth.js, Stripe, TailwindCSS, Zod, and more. If you prefer a more stable version, choose the `pinned` option during initialization and you'll get the pinned versions of each top-level dependency. The pinned versions can be found in `package-shadjs.json` in the shadjs GitHub repo.
